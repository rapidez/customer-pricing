# Rapidez Customer Pricing

This package adds Rapidez support for the [justbetter/magento2-customer-pricing magento extension](https://github.com/justbetter/magento2-customer-pricing). **This package will not work without this extension.**

## Installation

```
composer require rapidez/customer-pricing
```

## Usage

This adds to the Product model:
- A `customerPricing` relation that retrieves all customer prices and tiers for the given product
- The `customerPrice(int $customerId, int $quantity = 1)` function which returns a customer price at the given tier, or null when none is found.
- The `customerTierPrices(int $customerId)` function which returns all of the tier prices for a given customer (if any).
